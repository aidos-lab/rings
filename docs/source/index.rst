RINGS: Relevant Information in Node Features and Graph Structure documentation
==============================================================================

.. note::
   üöß This project is under active development. üöß

   We've made it public early to invite feedback, discussion, and transparency as we transition from research prototypes to a stable, user-friendly package.
   
   In the coming weeks, we‚Äôll be releasing updates, architectural notes, and implementation details via a series of pull requests. You're welcome to follow along, open issues, or suggest improvements!


Welcome to the official repository for the 2025 ICML paper, `No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.02379>`__, which introduces RINGS: a perturbation framework for attributed graphs, designed to facilitate more principled evaluations of graph learning benchmarks from first principles.



üíç Framework Overview
-----------------------

We are developing a community-friendly implementation of the **RINGS** framework introduced in the paper. Our goal is to make it easy for the graph learning community to:

- Apply dataset perturbations tailored to graph learning datasets
- Conduct more rigorous and insightful evaluations of both datasets and models
- Promote better dataset practices and evaluation hygiene across the field

If you have feedback on the paper or suggestions for how this package could better integrate with popular frameworks, please feel free to reach out to the authors.

üì¶ Installation
-----------------

RINGS uses `uv <https://github.com/astral-sh/uv>`_ as the package manager, which provides faster dependency resolution and installation.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Install ``uv`` if you don‚Äôt have it already:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install uv

Installing RINGS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clone the repository and install dependencies using ``uv``:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/aidos-lab/rings.git
   cd rings

   # Install dependencies
   uv sync

   # Activate environment
   source .venv/bin/activate

üöÄ Key Components
------------------

Available Perturbations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RINGS provides several perturbation transforms that can be applied to graph datasets:

**Node Feature Perturbations:**

- ``Original``: Keeps node features unchanged (baseline)
- ``EmptyFeatures``: Replaces node features with zero vectors
- ``RandomFeatures``: Replaces node features with random values
- ``CompleteFeatures``: Assigns unique one-hot vectors to nodes

**Graph Structure Perturbations:**

- ``EmptyGraph``: Removes all edges from the graph
- ``CompleteGraph``: Connects every pair of nodes
- ``RandomGraph``: Generates a random graph structure
- ``RandomConnectedGraph``: Generates a random graph that is guaranteed to be connected

ComplementarityFunctor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``ComplementarityFunctor`` measures the alignment between node features and graph structure by comparing their induced metric spaces. It can help you understand:

- Whether node features and graph structure contain complementary information
- How different perturbations affect this complementarity
- The distribution of information content across modalities in graph datasets

‚ú® Example Usage
-----------------

The repository includes an example script that demonstrates how to use RINGS to analyze graph datasets:

Mode Complementarity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example on the MUTAG dataset with original (unperturbed) graphs. The script will output complementarity statistics that measure how well node features align with graph structure in the dataset.

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m examples.complementarity --dataset MUTAG --perturbation original

Trying different perturbations.

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m examples.complementarity --dataset MUTAG --perturbation random-features
   python -m examples.complementarity --dataset MUTAG --perturbation empty-graph

Using a different TU dataset.

.. code:: bash

   python -m examples.complementarity --dataset ENZYMES --perturbation original
