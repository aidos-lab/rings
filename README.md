# RINGS

This is the official repository for our ICML paper:

**[No Metric to Rule Them All: Toward Principled Evaluations of Graph-Learning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02379)**

which introduces **RINGS**: a perturbation framework for attributed graphs, designed to facilitate more principled evaluations of graph learning benchmarks from first principles.

## üöß Repository Status

This repository is **under active development**.
We've made it public early to invite feedback, discussion, and **transparency** as we transition from research prototypes to a stable, user-friendly package.

In the coming weeks, we‚Äôll be releasing updates, architectural notes, and implementation details via a series of pull requests. You're welcome to follow along, open issues, or suggest improvements!

## üöÄ Current MVP Release

This initial release is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that includes:

- A set of **graph perturbation transformations** for manipulating node features and graph structure
- The **ComplementarityFunctor**, which computes mode complementarity between node features and graph structure
- Example scripts demonstrating usage with PyTorch Geometric datasets

---

## üíç Framework Overview

We are developing a community-friendly implementation of the **RINGS** framework introduced in the paper. Our goal is to make it easy for the graph learning community to:

- Apply dataset perturbations tailored to graph learning datasets
- Conduct more rigorous and insightful evaluations of both datasets and models
- Promote better dataset practices and evaluation hygiene across the field

If you have feedback on the paper or suggestions for how this package could better integrate with popular frameworks, please feel free to reach out to the authors.

## üì¶ Installation

RINGS uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as the package manager, which provides faster dependency resolution and installation.

### Prerequisites

1. Install `uv` if you don‚Äôt have it already:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Installing RINGS

Clone the repository and install dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aidos-lab/rings.git
cd rings

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## üßπ Key Components

### Available Perturbations

RINGS provides several perturbation transforms that can be applied to graph datasets:

**Node Feature Perturbations:**

- `Original`: Keeps node features unchanged (baseline)
- `EmptyFeatures`: Replaces node features with zero vectors
- `RandomFeatures`: Replaces node features with random values
- `CompleteFeatures`: Assigns unique one-hot vectors to nodes

**Graph Structure Perturbations:**

- `EmptyGraph`: Removes all edges from the graph
- `CompleteGraph`: Connects every pair of nodes
- `RandomGraph`: Generates a random graph structure
- `RandomConnectedGraph`: Generates a random graph that is guaranteed to be connected

### ComplementarityFunctor

The `ComplementarityFunctor` measures the alignment between node features and graph structure by comparing their induced metric spaces. It can help you understand:

- Whether node features and graph structure contain complementary information
- How different perturbations affect this complementarity
- The distribution of information content across modalities in graph datasets

## üîç Example Usage

The repository includes an example script that demonstrates how to use RINGS to analyze graph datasets:

### Complementarity Analysis

```bash
# Run the example on the MUTAG dataset with original (unperturbed) graphs
python examples/complementarity.py --dataset MUTAG --perturbation original

# Try different perturbations
python examples/complementarity.py --dataset MUTAG --perturbation random-features
python examples/complementarity.py --dataset MUTAG --perturbation empty-graph

# Analyze a different TU dataset
python examples/complementarity.py --dataset ENZYMES --perturbation original

# Get help and see all available options
python examples/complementarity.py --help
```

The script will output complementarity statistics that measure how well node features align with graph structure in the dataset.
